useProgressWebSocket.ts:377 ✨ Conversational summary received: This is  an Allied Benefit Systems commission statement for INNOVATIVE BPS LLC dated August 6, 2025, covering 70 commission entries across 11 distinct logistics and transportation groups, though the total commission amount shows a net debit of $141.14 due to significant negative adjustments. PRIDE DELIVERY SERVIC emerges as the top performer with gross commissions totaling $2,318.37 (including payments of $1,256.53 and $1,194.57 offset by a $132.73 deduction), followed by LUDICROUS SPEED LOGI generating $1,389.84 across multiple entries (with the largest single payment at $925.23), and SITIJI IN showing extensive activity with 47 separate line items totaling approximately $930 in positive commissions before adjustments. The statement reveals a complex portfolio heavily weighted toward logistics companies, with notable patterns including multiple recurring monthly charges and reversals for SITIJI IN (alternating between $58.62 credits and $61.14 debits), complete forfeitures for BTK RUSH IN ($305.40 in total debits), and mixed performance across the transportation sector with several groups showing both positive earnings and subsequent chargebacks.
