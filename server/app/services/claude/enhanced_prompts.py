<instructions>
**STEP 1: Visual Document Analysis**
Examine the document visually to understand:
• Overall layout and structure
• Table locations and boundaries
• Header hierarchy and formatting
• Grouping indicators (borders, spacing, indentation)
• Visual relationships between elements

**STEP 2: Entity Extraction with Visual Context**
<entities_to_extract>
<carrier>
• Name: The insurance company (look in headers, logos, footers)
• Confidence: Your certainty level (0.0-1.0)
• Evidence: Where you found it (e.g., "Header logo and letterhead")
</carrier>

<broker_agent>
• Company Name: The receiving broker/agent organization
• Location: Address if present
• Contact: If shown
• Confidence: Your certainty level
• Evidence: Where you found it
</broker_agent>

<writing_agents>
For each unique agent mentioned:
• Agent Number: If present
• Agent Name: Full name as shown
• Groups Handled: List of groups/companies they service
• Role: (e.g., "Writing Agent", "Agent 2", etc.)
</writing_agents>

<document_metadata>

• Statement Number: Document ID
• Payment Type: (e.g., EFT, Check, Wire)
• Report Date: If different from statement date
• Date Range: If period-based (start and end dates)
• Total Pages: Document length
</document_metadata>

<groups_and_companies>
For each group/company found:
• Group Number: Identifier
• Group Name: Full company/group name

• Stoploss Total: If applicable
• Agent Rate: Percentage or PEPM
• Calculation Method: (e.g., "Premium Equivalent", "PEPM")
• Census Count: Number of members/policies
• Paid Amount: Net commission
• Special Notes: Any unique attributes
</groups_and_companies>
</entities_to_extract>

**STEP 3: Hierarchical Structure Detection**
<structure_analysis>
Using visual cues (indentation, spacing, borders, grouping):
• Identify parent-child relationships
• Detect section headers vs. data rows
• Map multi-level table hierarchies
• Recognize summary rows and totals
• Understand data groupings and sections
</structure_analysis>

**STEP 4: Business Intelligence Extraction**
<business_intelligence>
• Commission Structure: Identify types (PEPM, %, flat, tiered)
• Payment Patterns: Who receives what and why
• Key Contributors: Top 3 groups by commission amount
• Special Payments: Bonuses, incentives, adjustments
• Temporal Info: Billing periods, activity periods
• Anomalies: Unusual patterns or outliers
</business_intelligence>

**STEP 5: Table Extraction with Context**
Extract all tables with:
• Headers: Preserve multi-line headers with proper joining
• Data Rows: Include all data with exact values
• Summary Rows: Flag totals and subtotals
• Row Context: Identify what each row represents
• Column Semantics: Understand what each column means
• Relationships: Parent-child connections in hierarchical tables

<critical_guidelines>
1. **Use Visual Context**: Leverage the visual layout to understand structure
2. **Extract Relationships**: Don't just extract data, map how entities connect
3. **Semantic Understanding**: Understand what the data means, not just what it says
4. **Comprehensive Capture**: Get ALL entities, not just the obvious ones
5. **Business Intelligence**: Extract insights, patterns, and key findings
6. **Confidence Scoring**: Provide honest confidence levels for each extraction
7. **Evidence Tracking**: Document where you found each piece of information
</critical_guidelines>

<examples>
**Example 1: Hierarchical Structure Detection**
Visual Cue: Indented rows under "Writing Agent Name: ANAT GOLDSTEIN"
Interpretation: These groups are managed by this specific agent
Action: Map agent-to-group relationships

**Example 2: Financial Entity Recognition**
Visual Cue: Dollar amounts in rightmost column with bold total row
Interpretation: Individual commissions with aggregated total
Action: Flag summary row, calculate validation sum

**Example 3: Temporal Context**
Visual Cue: Multiple date columns (Billing Period, Adj. Period)
Interpretation: Commission spans multiple time periods with adjustments
Action: Extract both current and adjustment period dates

**STEP 1: Analyze the Data**
Internally review:
• What type of document is this?
• Who are the key entities (carrier, broker, agents)?
• What is the total financial picture?
• Who are the top contributors?
• What patterns or special features exist?
• What time period(s) are covered?

**STEP 2: Structure Your Summary**
Create a 3-4 sentence paragraph that flows naturally:

Sentence 1: Document identification
• Type, carrier, broker, date, and document number
• Example: "This is an ABSF Commission Payment Summary from Allied Benefit for INNOVATIVE BPS LLC, dated August 6, 2025 (document G0223428)"

Sentence 2: Financial overview with key contributors
• Total amount, number of groups, and top 2-3 earners with amounts
• Example: "The document details $3,604.95 in total commissions across 11 groups, with LUDICROUS SPEED LOGI as the largest contributor at $1,384.84 (38% of total), followed by FUZION EXPRESS LL at $514.61 and G & N LOGISTICS LL at $468.84"

Sentence 3: Structure and agent information
• Commission structures, agent details, and payment types
• Example: "ANAT GOLDSTEIN serves as the Writing Agent for 8 groups using Premium Equivalent calculation method, while LIOR C GOLDSTEIN manages the remaining 3 groups, with payments processed via EFT"

Sentence 4 (if applicable): Notable features
• Special payments, anomalies, or unique characteristics
• Example: "The statement includes both current period charges and prior period adjustments, with census counts ranging from -1 (adjustments) to 13 members"

**STEP 3: Quality Check**
Ensure your summary:
☑ Names specific entities (carriers, brokers, agents, companies)
☑ Includes exact amounts and percentages
☑ Identifies top contributors with values
☑ Mentions payment type and commission structures
☑ Highlights any special features or patterns
☑ Flows naturally as conversational prose
☑ Contains NO bullet points or field labels
☑ Reads like a human explaining to another human

**OUTPUT FORMAT**
Return ONLY the summary paragraph. Do not include:
• Preambles ("Here's a summary:")
• Bullet points or lists
• Field labels ("Carrier:", "Date:")
• Closing remarks ("Let me know if you need more details")

Start immediately with "This is..." or "This document..." and provide the rich, flowing summary.
</instructions>
