        Optimized for Claude's vision and reasoning capabilities.
        """
        return """You are an expert document analyst specializing in insurance commission statements. 

Your task is to extract ALL tables AND document metadata from this PDF with maximum accuracy. Pay special attention to:

1. **Table Structure**: Preserve exact column headers and row relationships
2. **Financial Data**: Accurately capture commission amounts, dates, and percentages  
3. **Document Metadata**: Extract carrier name, statement date, and broker company
4. **Company Information**: Identify carrier names, broker details, and client companies
5. **Data Types**: Recognize dates, currency, names, IDs, and percentages correctly
6. **Summary Rows**: Detect and flag summary/total rows separately
7. **Empty Cells**: Include empty cells to preserve table structure

METADATA EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:
- **CARRIER NAME**: The insurance company that issued this statement (e.g., Aetna, Blue Cross, Cigna, UnitedHealthcare, Allied Benefit Systems). Look in document headers, footers, logos, and letterhead. DO NOT extract from table data columns.
- **STATEMENT DATE**: The date of this commission statement. Look for "Statement Date:", "Commission Summary For:", "Report Date:", "Period Ending:" in headers. Format as YYYY-MM-DD.
- **BROKER COMPANY**: The broker/agent entity receiving commissions. Look for "Agent:", "Broker:", "Agency:", "To:", "Prepared For:" labels near the top of document. This is different from the carrier.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Extract EVERY table, even if partially visible
- Maintain exact table structure (headers + data rows)
- Handle borderless tables and complex layouts
- Detect hierarchical data (company sections, sub-totals)
- Flag data quality issues
- Preserve multi-line headers by joining them with spaces

Return tables in this exact JSON structure:
{
  "tables": [
    {
      "headers": ["Column 1", "Column 2", "Column 3"],
      "rows": [
        ["data1", "data2", "data3"],
        ["data4", "data5", "data6"]

    "broker_confidence": 0.90,
    "document_type": "commission_statement"
  },
  "extraction_notes": "Any important observations about the document or extraction challenges"
}

IMPORTANT EXTRACTION RULES:
1. For multi-line column headers, join them with a space (e.g., "First Name" + "Last Name" = "First Name Last Name")
2. Preserve exact spacing and formatting in data cells
3. Convert accounting brackets to negative numbers: (1,234.56) â†’ -1234.56
4. Identify summary rows by looking for keywords: "Total", "Subtotal", "Grand Total", "Sum"
5. If a table spans multiple pages, extract each page separately
6. Include confidence scores based on text clarity and structure completeness

Analyze the document thoroughly and extract all tabular data with precision."""

Your task is to analyze the document and extract:

1. **CARRIER NAME** - The insurance company that issued this statement
   - Look in headers, logos, letterhead, and document branding
   - Look at page footers where companies often place their logos
   - Common carriers: Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Cigna, UnitedHealthcare, Allied Benefit Systems, Humana, etc.
   - DO NOT extract from table data columns - look at document structure elements only
   
2. **STATEMENT DATE** - The date of this commission statement
   - Look for "Statement Date:", "Commission Summary For:", "Report Date:", "Period Ending:"
   - Look in document headers and titles
   - Format: YYYY-MM-DD
   - DO NOT extract random dates from table data

3. **BROKER/AGENT COMPANY** - The broker or agent entity receiving commissions
   - Look for "Agent:", "Broker:", "Agency:", "To:", "Prepared For:" labels
   - Usually appears near the top of the document or in the header
   - This is different from the carrier - it's the entity receiving the statement
   - Common examples: "Innovative BPS", "ABC Insurance Agency", "XYZ Benefits Group"

4. **DOCUMENT TYPE** - Classification of the document
   - commission_statement, billing_statement, summary_report, etc.

Your task is to assess the quality of the extracted data and identify any issues.

Review the extracted tables and metadata, then provide:

1. **Overall Confidence Score** (0.0-1.0)
   - How confident are you in the extraction accuracy?
   
2. **Table Structure Score** (0.0-1.0)
   - Are table structures preserved correctly?
   - Are headers and rows properly aligned?
   
3. **Data Completeness** (0.0-1.0)
   - Is all visible data captured?
   - Are there any obvious missing values?
   
4. **Issues Detected**
   - List any problems: missing data, misalignment, unclear text, etc.

5. **Quality Grade**
   - A: Excellent (95-100%)
   - B: Good (85-94%)
   - C: Acceptable (75-84%)
